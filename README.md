## About the Author

Hi, I'm **Natália Schardosim** — a backend-focused software engineering student at 42 Berlin, transitioning from a background in hospitality.

This project reflects my interest in building robust, domain-driven backend systems with Go and PostgreSQL, combining real-world operational experience with modern backend architecture practices.

You can find more of my work on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn.

> _Node.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker_ • Microservices, JWT Auth, Websockets, CI/CD

### 🧠 [Room Assignment Advisor](https://github.com/schardot/room-assignment-advisor)
_in progress_
AI-assisted tool that recommends hotel room assignments by combining deterministic rules with lightweight LLM interpretation of guest notes, keeping decisions explainable and human-in-the-loop.

> _Python, LangChain, CSV Processing_ • Rule Engines, AI-Assisted Systems, Explainability

### 🌐 [webserv](https://github.com/vados-sa/webserv)
Custom HTTP/1.1 web server built in C++. Handles static content, request parsing, and CGI execution, inspired by NGINX.
